# Hiragana and katakana characters with small versions

There are a few options for dealing with these:

- Do nothing
- Convert the small versions to their regular-sized counterparts
- Remove the small versions

I’ve not got much of an attachment to any of the options, so I’ll make a decision when I have to work with them.
